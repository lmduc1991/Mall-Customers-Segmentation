### **Project Overview**

In this project, as the owner of the mall, we will ultilize **unsupervise machine learning techniques** to perform mall customers segmentation. The objective of the segmentation is to help the marketing team know who are target customers so they can focus on when running marketing campaign.

There are 4 different algorithms will be used and presetented in this project: K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering, DBSCAN and K-Prototype

### **Data Understanding**

**The Mall Customers dataset** is a collection of customer basic information and their spending score respectively. The dataset can be retrieved from [kaggle website](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vjchoudhary7/customer-segmentation-tutorial-in-python). During feature engineering, some variables were transform and values were removed in order to fit the data at its best. Data columns detail is explained below:

        1. CustomerID                   unique customer number - numerical (int)
        2. Gender                       customer gender - binary categorical (object)
        3. Age                          customer age - numerical (int)
        4. Annual Income                annual income of customer - numerical (int)
        5. Spending Score               score the mall assign to the customer based on your defined parameters like customer behavior and purchasing data. - numerical (int
